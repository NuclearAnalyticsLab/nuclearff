\details{
\code{get_te_ngs_advstats_season} is a function to obtain NFL Next Gen
Stats (NGS) for an entire season or multiple seasons.
The function utilizes the \code{nflreadr} function \code{load_nextgen_stats} to load
player level weekly stats starting with the 2016 season.
For receivers, the \code{stat_type} is defined as \code{receiving} and is updated
every night.
NGS will only provide data for players above a minimum number of receptions.
More information is available about NGS stats from
\href{https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/glossary}{NGS glossary}.
